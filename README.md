# Custom Interpreter

This is a custom interpreter I am in the process of writing. The initial plan was to make it with the "Calc" toy language specification (hence the references to `.calc`), but I think I will use my own language specification (still haven't decided on that completely yet).

This project is for my own use, to learn about the intricacies of making an interpreter. I decided to go with an interpreter instead of a compiler to make it a little easier on myself.

The plan for this language is to act as a calculator that is customized to my needs (eg. cryptographic techniques, circuit analysis-specific computations, and anything else I might need.)

This project had been created and is entirely owned by Kade Angell.
